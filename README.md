# JAI-programs

Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) is a Java platform extension API which allows developers to create their own image manipulation routines.
JAI provides a core set of the operators required to support the basic imaging technologies.
These operators support many of the functions required for an imaging application.

Here, I have created simple, easy and flexible filters which can be used to edit an Image using Java Advanced Imaging- JAI (API)

1. To read and write image file in Java
    Filename: MyImage.java

2. To convert a color image into a Grayscale Image
    Filename: MyGrayscale.java

3. To convert a color image into a Sepia Image
    Filename: MySepiaFilter.java

4. To convert a color image into a Red Image
    Filename: MyRedFilter.java

5. To convert a color image into a Green Image
    Filename: MyGreenFilter.java

6. To convert a color image into a Blue Image
    Filename: MyBlueFilter.java
    
7. To convert an image to negative
    Filename: MyNegativeImage.java
    
8. To create a random pixel image
    Filename: MyCreatedImage.java

9. To create a mirror image
    Filename: MyMirrorImage.java
    
Compile using: javac filename.java
Run using: java filename
